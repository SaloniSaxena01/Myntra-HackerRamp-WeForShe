Team: ALPHA GEEKS

Almost everyone wishes to try items before they buy them but are unable to do so due to the online shopping mode. The pandemic has further made comfortable online shopping the need of the hour.The lack of physical shopping experience causes approximately 23% of all clothing to get returned, and 64% of consumers say incorrect fit is the primary reason they return clothing as it is not easy to predict that which size would best fit on them.

# Solution
We are offering a secure solution where a user can capture his/her entire body picture and upload it on Myntra app. The system will scan the body size and suggest the best fit of a particular clothing that the customer has selected. The customer can also virtually try on the clothes to decide whether it looks good on their specific body type or not. This will increase the customer satisfaction and thus the sales of the Myntra App.
